This is a repo for ids706 project1: Write a Big Data Script that uses the Pandas API for Spark or Dask
  video introduction link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szz15mLpWsw
  In this project, I would use the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fireballbyedimyrnmom/us-counties-covid-19-dataset), the covid-19 cases dataset to create a fastapi microservice, which can show the lastest datapoint of an special state.
